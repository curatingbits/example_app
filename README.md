This is an example of an application that I would like to see replicated when interviewing new hires
-------
**The Task.**

What I would like for you to do is create a new rails application. Once you have done that, create an index page and set a root route to that index file. Within that index file, show you know how to  import both the css and js docs for bootstrap. Next, show just a basic example of text spanned across 3 columns. I don't care how you attach bootstrap, but would be neat if you used the bootstrap-sass gem. Create a new repository on your Github, commit and push your rails app to that repository so I can review your work.

By being able to complete this task, it shows you understand how to create a new rails app, work with view files, apply a gem and have little knowledge of routes.
Where you should show off your front end web development skills is in your index file within the three columns :). However it's not required.

**Cloning and resubmitting my example app as your work is not cool, build it from scratch!**

Below is an image of what your development server should look like.

I should be able to clone your app and run it in my development environment without any issues!

**Bonus Points(not required)**
- If you use HAML
- If you import the data for the columns from a db
- If you write seed data to populate db
- Write a test *big time bonus points for this item*
- Actually use ths bootstrap js and show an example in one of the 3 columns.
