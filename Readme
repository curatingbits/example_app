<h3> This is an example of an application that I would like to see replicated when interviewing new hires </h3>
<h2>The Task.</h2>

<p>What I would like for you to do is create a new rails application. Once you have done that, create an index page and set a root route to that index file. Within that index file, show you know how to  import both the css and js docs for bootstrap. Next show just a basic example of text spanned across 3 columns. I don't care how you attach bootstrap, but would be neat if you used the bootstrap-sass gem. Create a new repository on your Github, commit and push your rails app to that repository so I can review your work.</p>

<p> By being able to complete this task, it shows you understand how to create a new rails app, work with view files, apply a gem and have little knowledge of routes.
Where you should show off your front end web development skills is in your index file within the three columns :). However it's not required.</p>

<h3>Cloning and resubmitting my example app as your work is not cool</h3>

<p>Since this really basic rails app doesn't use a db of any kind, it's fine if you create your app with rail new your_app -0</p>
